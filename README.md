# Git Event Manager

Git Event Manager is a graphical user interface application based on Tkinter for managing events in a Git repository. The core code was initially generated by an AI language model and subsequently modified and optimized for better functionality and user experience.

## Project Background

This project combines AI-generated code with human modifications to create a practical Git management tool. The base implementation was generated using a large language model, with subsequent refinements and optimizations made to enhance functionality, improve error handling, and ensure better user experience.

## Overview of Features

- **Select Git Repository Path**: Users can select a local Git repository for management.
- **Branch Creation**: Supports creating new branches based on prefix, date, and custom suffix.
- **Merge Operations**: Allows selecting multiple branches or tags for merging.
- **Tag Creation**: Supports creating new tags based on prefix, date, and custom suffix.
- **Event History**: View and search historical events, including branch and tag creation, merge information, etc.
- **Push to Remote**: Supports pushing the current branch and tag to the remote repository.
- **Git User Information Configuration**: Checks and configures Git username and email.

## Technical Implementation

The application is built using:
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter for GUI
- GitPython for Git operations
- Object-oriented programming principles
- AI-assisted code generation with human optimization

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter library (usually comes with Python)
- GitPython library

### Installation

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install gitpython
```

### Running the Application

Navigate to the project directory and run:

```bash
python main.py
```

## Usage Guide

### Basic Operations

1. **Repository Selection**
   - Click "Browse" to select a Git repository
   - The application will automatically load repository information

2. **Branch Management**
   - Enable branch creation
   - Select prefix type or enter custom prefix
   - Add custom suffix and date if needed
   - Create new branch with generated name

3. **Merge Operations**
   - Select source branches/tags
   - Execute merge operation
   - View merge results in history

4. **Tag Management**
   - Create tags with custom naming patterns
   - Manage existing tags
   - Push tags to remote

5. **History Tracking**
   - View complete operation history
   - Search through past events
   - Access detailed information for each operation

### Best Practices

- Always verify the repository path before operations
- Review generated names before creating branches or tags
- Check merge conflicts before confirming operations
- Verify remote repository permissions before pushing

## Development Notes

- The core functionality was initially generated using AI
- Code structure and error handling have been manually optimized
- GUI layout and user interaction flows have been refined based on testing
- Additional features can be added through the existing framework
